# PromptShell
PromptShell is a smart terminal powered by AI. You can type natural language commands like “go to Data folder” or “show my files,” and it converts them into real shell commands. It remembers your current directory and keeps track of past commands during the session. Built with Streamlit and Gemini AI.
